# Hrypton password manager
access to your passwords anywhere and anytime without saving anything

# main idea
what if you have a algorithm that can generate password with your inputs? so you don't need to save them because you can generate it later with same inputs
</br></br>
my algorithm is a hash based on sha256 and its so slow (so its very hard to crack even for super computers)
</br></br>
knowing that 
krypton is superman weakness <br>
Hrypton can be super computers weakness
</br></br>
and input parameters are:</br>

1. Master password
2. URL of website that you need passwoed for it
3. Your username

</br>
and this algorithm generates standard passwords that contains lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special charecters

# naming
<b>H</b>ash + K<b>rypton</b> -> <b>Hrypton</b>

# talk is cheap show me the code
ok checkout <a href="app/src/main/java/com/ali77gh/pash/core/Pasher.kt">this </a>.

# how it looks?

green like krypton
