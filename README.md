# Crypton password manager
save your password no where and access from everywhere.

# main idea
what if you have a algorithm that can generate password with your inputs? so you don't need to save them (because you can generate it later with same inputs)
</br></br>
my algorithm is a hash based on sha256 and its so slow (so its very hard to crack even for super computers)
</br></br>
so:
</br>
krypton is superman weakness <br>
crypton is super computers weakness
</br></br>
and input parameters are:</br>

1. Master password
2. URL of website that you need passwoed for it
3. Your username

# naming
it comes from krypton (super man weakness)(its green) and it mixed with crypto.

# talk is cheap show me the code
